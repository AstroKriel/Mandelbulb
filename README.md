# Mandelbulb

Small and simple project where I program a Mandelbulb-set renderer from scratch using both C++ and Python.

The cpp folder is the final product. The python folder was used for development, but does the same thing, just slower.

Compile the C++ code from within the cpp/srs folder uisng (windows): 
> g++ -Wall -Wextra -fopenmp .\srs\main.cpp -o program

and run it to generate data. You can then plot the generated data with a python plotting code 'plot_data' that I provide. This code relies on ffmpeg to create mp4 animations, which you can get from here: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

This project combined some interesting topics:
- Ray marching: to find out what the camera sees.
- Signed Distance Functions: to find out how far a ray can safely march in a particular direction.
- Lots of Linear Algebra: for rotating the camera and light source.
